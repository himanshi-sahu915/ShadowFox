Ease of Use:
- Matplotlib: Slightly complex and requires more coding for customization.  
- Seaborn: Easier to use with attractive default themes.

Customization:
- Matplotlib: Offers high customization options, such as colors, labels, titles, ticks, etc.  
- Seaborn: Limited customization options but provides visually appealing out-of-the-box visualizations.

Interactivity:
- Matplotlib: For interactive graphs, additional tools like `mpld3` need to be used.  
- Seaborn: Lacks built-in support for interactive visualizations but is excellent for simple static plots.

Handling Large Datasets:
- Matplotlib: Handles large datasets efficiently.  
- Seaborn: Performance can be slower with large datasets, especially for complex plots.
