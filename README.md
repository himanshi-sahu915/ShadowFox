# Introduction  
Matplotlib and Seaborn are two popular libraries in Python used for data visualization.  
- Matplotlib is a versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots.  
- Seaborn builds on top of Matplotlib and provides a simpler, more elegant interface for creating statistical graphics.  

In this document, we will cover the basics of both libraries, the types of graphs they can create, and their comparison.
